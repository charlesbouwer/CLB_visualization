Open data visualization of the Canada Learning Bond take up rate by FSA.
This project uses the forward sortation area boundary file from the 2016 census of Canada and some open data on the take up of the Canada Learning Bond to create a map of the bond's use across Canada. This can serve to help the program target underserved areas or inform further questioning into the use of the bond and post secondary education across Canada.
